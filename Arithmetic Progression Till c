/* The program must accept three integers A, B and C as the input. The program must print the
arithmetic progression starting from A with common difference B up to C as output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= A, B, C <= 10^7
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of A, B and C separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains list of integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 7 25
Output:
4 11 18 25
Explanation:
The output is printed from A so 4 is printed.
Then 7 is added to 4 so the next integer to be printed is 11.
Then 7 is added to 11 so the next integer to be printed is 18.
Then 7 is added to 18 so the next integer to be printed is 25.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
45 3 59
Output:
45 48 51 54 57 */
