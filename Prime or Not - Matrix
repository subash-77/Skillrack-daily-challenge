Prime or Not - Matrix
The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as the input. For each integer in the matrix, the
program must replace all the prime numbers by 1 and all the non-prime numbers by 0. Then the
program must print the modified matrix as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= R, C <= 100
2 <= Each Integer Value <= 10000
Input Format:
The first line contains two integers R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines contain C integers each separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line R lines contain C integers each separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2 3
2 5 9 
6 8 3 
Output:
1 1 0 
0 0 1 
Explanation:
In the 1st
row and the 1st column of the matrix, 2 is a prime number. So 1 is printed.
In the 1st
row and the 2nd
column of the matrix, 5 is a prime number. So 1 is printed.
In the 1st
row and the 3rd
column of the matrix, 9 is not a prime number. So 0 is printed.
In the 2nd
row and the 1st column of the matrix, 6 is not a prime number. So 0 is printed.
In the 2nd
row and the 2nd
column of the matrix, 8 is not a prime number. So 0 is printed.
In the 2nd
row and the 3rd
column of the matrix, 3 is a prime number. So 1 is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 4
10 20 30 40
29 37 73 91
50 57 52 53
Output:
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1
