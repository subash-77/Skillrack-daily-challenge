The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must replace all the even digits
in N by 1 and replace all the odd digits in N by 2. Then the program must print the modified value
of N as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^9
Input Format:
The first line contains the value of N.
Output Format:
The first line contains the modified value of N.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
465189
Output:
112212
Explanation:
All the even digits are in 465189 are replaced by 1.
All the odd digits are in 465189 are replaced by 2.
Hence the output is 112212
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
212112
Output:
121221

CODE:

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Your Code Here
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        long n=sc.nextLong();
        String s="";
        while(n!=0)
        {
            long d=n%10;
            if(d%2==0)
            {
               s='1'+s;
            }
            if(d%2==1)
            {
               s='2'+s;
            }
            n=n/10;
        }
        System.out.print(s);
	}
}
