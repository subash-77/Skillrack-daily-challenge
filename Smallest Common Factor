Smallest Common Factor
The program must accept two positive integers N1 and N2 as the input. The program must print the
smallest common factor of N1 and N2 which is greater than 1 as the output. If there is no common
factor other than 1 then the program must print -1 as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N1, N2 <= 10^8
Input Format:
The first line contains the values of N1 and N2 separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the common factor.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
15 30
Output:
3
Explanation:
3 is the smallest number (greater than 1) which divides both 15 and 30.
Hence 3 is printed.
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3 7
Output:
-1

CODE:

var readline = require('readline');
var reader = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  terminal: true
});

var lines = [];

reader.on('line', function (line) {
    lines.push(line);
});

reader.on('close', function () {
    // Start here
    let input=lines[0].split(" ");
    let n1=input[0];
    let n2=input[1];
    
    var f=0,small=n1;
    if(small>n2)
    {
        small=n2;
    }
    for(let i=2;i<small;i++)
    {
        if(n1%i==0 && n2%i==0)
        {
            f=1;
            console.log(i);
            break;
        }
    }
    if(f==0)
    {
        console.log("-1");
    }
    
});
